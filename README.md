This repository demonstrates a common Dockerfile error where the script to be executed isn't properly referenced or the working directory isn't set up correctly. The original Dockerfile fails because the script path is assumed to be in the container's root directory and no entrypoint or working directory is set. The solution Dockerfile corrects this by specifying the working directory and setting an entrypoint or CMD instruction.
